# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves categorizing images into predefined classes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial patterns and hierarchies in image data. This project focuses on image classification using CNN with the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes include objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms and evaluating model performance.

## Methodology

The project follows the following steps to perform image classification using CNN:

1. Data Preprocessing: The CIFAR-10 dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1. This ensures that the data is in a consistent format and helps with model convergence.

2. Model Architecture: A CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The architecture typically includes a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Activation functions such as ReLU are applied to introduce non-linearity in the model.

3. Model Training: The CNN model is trained using the preprocessed training dataset. The training process involves forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight optimization using gradient descent algorithms. The model is iteratively trained on the data to minimize the prediction error.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the preprocessed testing dataset. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance in classifying the test images.

5. Prediction: The trained model can be used to classify new, unseen images. The input image needs to be preprocessed in the same manner as the training data before being fed into the model. The model outputs a probability distribution over the classes, indicating the likelihood of each class for the given image.


## Conclusion

The Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for image classification tasks. By training a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we can accurately classify images into their respective classes. The project provides a foundation for further research and development in computer vision and deep learning.
